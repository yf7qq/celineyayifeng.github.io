<h1>LIFE</h1>
<p>I was born in Guangdong, China. I moved to the US when I was 10, and have lived in Richmond, VA ever since. Some of my favorite things to do are singing, reading, exercising with Chloe Ting, and drinking bubble tea! My favorite bubble tea place in Richmond is <a href="https://www.brecotea.com/" target="_blank">BrecoTea Baking Studio</a>.</p>
<p>As you may have seen under Education, I withdrew from pursuing a Pharm.D. degree in 2021. There were a lot of struggles and uncertainties with changing my trajectory at that point of my life, but at the same time, I learned to be more determined and courageous through this change. One of the main contributors to this decision was my personal desire for a dynamic learning environment and challenges. Even before I started my undergraduate journey, I knew I was going into a pre-health career. I have never considered another option, and I was so focused on getting good grades in college and ignored exploring other potential interests. During my year in pharmacy school, I realized I was due for a change. It was difficult for me to imagine myself living a stagnant lifestyle and never stepping out of my comfort zone. Thus, I have embarked myself on a dynamic career path, and I am motivated to be a life-long learner. I am definitely a late game-changer, but I believe it is better to be late than never.</p>
